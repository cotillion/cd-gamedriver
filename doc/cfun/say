NAME
	say - send message to other livings in the environment of
              this_player()

SYNOPSIS
	varargs void say(mixed str, mixed oblist)

DESCRIPTION
        Sends a message (via catch_msg()) to other livings in
        the environment of this_player().  Note that this_player()
        will not receive the message.

        The first argument is the message (see catch_msg).

        The second argument is an object or an array of objects
        which should _not_ receive the message.  This may be 0
        if no objects should be excluded.

NOTES
	This is actually a CFUN and must be activated through the mudlib
	before it can be used.

EXAMPLE
	varargs void
	say(mixed str, mixed oblist) = "say";

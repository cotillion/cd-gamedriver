NAME
	tell_room - send message to livings in a room

SYNOPSIS
	varargs void tell_room(mixed room, mixed str, mixed oblist,
                               object from_player)

DESCRIPTION
        Sends a message (via catch_msg()) to livings in a given room.

        The first argument is the room object or filename.

        The second argument is the message (see catch_msg).

        The third argument is an object or an array of objects
        which should _not_ receive the message.  This may be 0
        if no objects should be excluded.

        The fourth argument is the object that generated the message.
        This defaults to this_player().

NOTES
	This is actually a CFUN and needs to be activated within the mudlib
	before it can be used.

EXAMPLE
	varargs void
	tell_room(mixed room, mixed str, mixed oblist = 0,
		  object from_player = this_player()) = "tell_room";

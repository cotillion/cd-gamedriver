NAME
	set_alarm, set_alarmv - delayed execution of a function
	
SYNOPSIS
	int set_alarm(float delay, float repeat, function func)

	OBSOLETE
	int set_alarm(float delay, float repeat, string func, ...)

	int set_alarmv(float delay, float repeat, string func, mixed *argarr)

DESCRIPTION
	With this function you can delay the call of a name function
	`func' for `delay' seconds.  If `repeat' is positive, then it is
	a repeating callout with repeat time repeat (like a heartbeat)
	 -- for example, if delay is 3.0, and repeat is 4.0 then the
        function will be called in 3 seconds and every 4 seconds after that.

	OBSOLETE
	  If `...' is specified it is passed as arguments to the function.
	 In the second form (set_alarmv()) the elements of the array argarr
	will be sent as arguments to the function, i.e. if argarr is an
	array with 3 elements the function will be called with 3 arguments.

RETURN VALUES
	The return value is the id of the alarm.

NOTA BENE
        Neither "this_interactive()" nor "this_player()" is defined
        in a function that has been called by "set_alarm()". If you
        have a `write()' statement in the function that is called 
        with `set_alarm()' the output will end up in the game log.

WARNING
	Never, ever, make a repeating alarm inside a repeating
	alarm.  The alarms generated will be exponential, and
	in less than a minute the entire mud will grind to a halt.
